# Simple React-UI

A tutorial on Building an interface with React by [Ray
Villalobos](https://github.com/planetoftheweb)

Done in ES5 for ease of learning React without the overhead of having to
learn ES6 module syntax.

Process directory is where the work goes, gulp and browserify will build
and compile into the *builds* directory when done.
